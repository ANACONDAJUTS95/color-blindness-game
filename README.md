# 🎨 ColorSense – The Color Perception Game

A fun, interactive **color perception game** built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** 🎮  
Test how well you can distinguish between colors and shades through simple visual challenges!

## 🧠 What is ColorSense?

ColorSense is a gamified way to explore how your eyes perceive color differences.  
You’ll be shown grids of colors, and your goal is to **spot the one that’s slightly different**.  
The more rounds you play, the better the system can highlight which color ranges you might struggle with.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> This game **does not diagnose color blindness** or any medical condition.  
> It’s designed to **help you identify which colors you personally find harder to distinguish**.  
> A proper diagnosis should always be done by an eye care professional.

## 🖥️ Recommended Setup

> 🌓 **Best Experience Tip:**  
> For the most accurate color perception, it’s **preferable (but not required)** to play this game on a device with an **OLED screen**.  
> OLED displays provide richer contrast and deeper color accuracy, helping the subtle hue differences stand out better.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. A grid of colored boxes will appear.  
2. One box has a **slightly different hue or brightness** — find it!  
3. As you progress, the difference becomes smaller and harder to spot.  
4. After several rounds, you’ll get your **results**:  
   - A summary of colors you found challenging  
   - A reminder that this is **not a medical diagnosis**

## 📊 Results & Insights

At the end of each session, you’ll see this message:

> “Note: This game does not determine if you're color blind, but it can help identify which colors you might have difficulty distinguishing.”

This helps you understand your **color sensitivity**, not your **medical condition**.
